# Spring Trace Open Bible Church


Welcome to the Spring Trace Opne Bible Church Website! This is the repository for the source code of the website that we developed for the church.

About the Church
STOBC is a community of believers who gather together to worship God and grow in their faith. The church is committed to sharing the love of Jesus with everyone they meet, and they want to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where people can come together to learn about Jesus, build relationships, and serve their community.

Features
The website that I developed for the church has the following features:

Home: The home page of the website provides an overview of the church and its mission. It also includes links to various sections of the website.

Services: The website includes information about the different services that the church offers, including traditional and contemporary services.

Ministries: The website provides information about the different ministries that the church offers, including small groups, youth groups, and mission opportunities.

Events: The website includes information about upcoming events and activities, including special services, volunteer opportunities, and community outreach events.

Contact Us: The website includes a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with the church.

Technologies Used
The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was built using the Bootstrap framework, which allowed me to create a responsive and mobile-friendly website. I also used jQuery to add interactivity to the website.

Conclusion
I am proud to have developed a website for the church that reflects their mission and values. This project allowed me to showcase my skills as a web developer and create a website that is both beautiful and functional.
